Hi Tony
I really enjoyed reading this well-written and interesting paper. I imagine that you seldom read qualitative studies, and I would like to commend you for the thoroughly and open-minded approach you have taken on this challenge. You could probably have given a somewhat more elaborated rationale for why you selected these two particular studies, and a sentence or two where you ground the selected topic (fairness in educational assessment) in your own research would not hurt anyone. That said, I am intrigued by the systematic, nuanced, and detailed comparison of the two studies, and the rigorous (but fair) evaluation of the strength and weaknesses concerning purpose statement, design, and implications in/of the two studies. You have obviously passed the course assignment, and I am quite impressed of the job you have done.
