%//mark [PowerPoint] Upon completion of part A, students are to have acquired an understanding of different qualitative methodologies and their relative strengths and weaknesses. They will be able to evaluate qualitative research on relevant criteria, and the quality of the results of such research. The course is intended to strengthen the studentsâ€™ competence in scientific reasoning and argumentation.

\section{Paper Summary} %//mark 250 words
%//mark Give a descriptive summary of the study

\textcite{hennessy:2021} presented a qualitative research project aimed at supporting practitioner-led inquiry into classroom dialogue. Using a design-based approach involving 74 participants raging from early education to the tertiary levels, the authors examined the effectiveness of the Teacher Scheme for Educational Dialogue Analysis (T-SEDA) resource pack for promoting teachers' implementation of dialogic pedagogy. By examining data derived from surveys, inquiry reports and interviews, Hennessy and colleagues reported significant effect sizes attributable to the T-SEDA in participating classrooms in terms of classroom dialogue implementation.

This paper began with a clear and purposeful introduction. The authors motivated their study with research gaps and limitations from unidirectional intervention designs --- an argument naturally led to a design-based research (DBR) methodology. A brief description of DBR was then given followed by listing its distinctive features. These paragraphs served non-specialists particularly well in terms of scaffolding and contextualising this project. Subsequently, Hennessy and colleagues linked T-SEDA's design principles to DBR by explicitly positioning practitioners as contributors to research knowledge. The introduction section ended with an outline, giving readers a clear structure and purpose for this paper.

\section{Credibility Examination} %//mark 200 words
%//mark Discuss the credibility of the study, by assessing:

This study has a mix success in establishing its research credibility.

\subsection{Internal Coherence} %//mark 200 words
%//mark Internal coherence (relations between research questions and design)

Internal coherence refers to the connection between the research questions and the research design. The authors listed two research questions: a) ``Why might individual practitioners engage with and disengage from T-SEDA inquiry?'' and b) ``What are the organisational structures and circumstances supporting engagement with T-SEDA in different local settings?'' and employed a design-based approach in exploring the answers. In answering the ``why'' question, Hennessy and colleagues conducted

\subsection{Transparency of Research Process} %//mark 200 words
%//mark Transparency of the research process: How data was collected description of the analytical strategy, empirical grounding of claims

\poscite{hennessy:2021} study is highly transparent in its research process. Under the guidance of \textcite[][pp. 185--187]{creswell:2018}, the study authors have demonstrated a purposeful selection of participants, discussed the recruitment strategy, commented on the number of participants, indicated the type of data that had been collected

\subsection{Validation Strategies} %//mark 200 words
%//mark Reported validation strategies, scope and form of conclusions

\section{Discussion} %//mark 1000 words
