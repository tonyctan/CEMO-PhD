\textcite{hennessy:2021} presented a qualitative research project aimed at supporting practitioner-led inquiry into classroom dialogue. Using a design-based approach involving 74 participants raging from early education to the tertiary levels, the authors examined the effectiveness of the Teacher Scheme for Educational Dialogue Analysis (T-SEDA) resource pack for promoting teachers' implementation of classroom dialogue. By examining data derived from surveys, inquiry reports and interviews, Hennessy and colleagues reported significant effect sizes attributable to T-SEDA in participating classrooms in terms of classroom dialogue effectiveness.
