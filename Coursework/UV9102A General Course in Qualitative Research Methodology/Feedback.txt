It was a pleasure to read this very well-written and well-structured paper, Tony! You use the course literature really well, and I am very glad to see that you found the entire paper assignment meaningful. All the points you have about strengths of the Hennesy et al (2021) paper are valid, and you justify them well. That being said, I am slightly surprised that you do not have more critical remarks! In particular, the sampling strategy of the paper and the final sample could easily be critiqued for being quite favorable to the article? This is not a critique of you paper, just a remark that while this is a solid study, it also has some issues (like all research). The paper is definitely passed.
