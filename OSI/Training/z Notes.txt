At the beginning of each new semester, we need to send invoices to each member. There should be two invoices: one from OSI (membership fee) and one from OSI Svomming (training fee).

On the left-hand-side black menu, under "Medlemsadmin" (Memberhsip management), click "Avgifter" (Fees). Go to the bottom of the screen, click the blue button "Opprett ny avgift" (Create new fees):

2. Approve new members

[WARNING: ONLY ACCEPT NEW MEMBERS UNDER THE APPROVAL OF THE PRESIDENT!]

We do not need to manually add members to the system. Individuals must create a profile and enter personal information on the OSI website. We pull this information from the database, such as whether this individual is a student or not. We only need to approave each membership application so that an OSI Svomming training fee invoice can be pushed to the member.

From 2021, we flush out all members at the end of each year and anyone who wish to return must re-register with us. This eliminates the tedeous process of tracking members--many of whome have already left Norway such as exchange students.

Go to the left-hand-side black menu.
Go to "Medlemsadmin" (Membership management).
Go to "Innmeldinger" (Incoming members).
Click the red number above "Ubehandlede soknader" (Unprocessed applications).
[STOP! HAVE YOU OBTAINED PERMISSION FROM THE PRESIDENT YET? IF YES, CONTINUE...]
Go to the right-most column "Ga til behandling" (Processing).
Click "Valg" (Options).
Verify the information members entered to make sure there is no obvious mistakes (e.g., DOB = 01/01/1887). If nothing wrong, click "Fortsett" (Continue).
Click the green "+ Meld inn" (Sign in).
Click the green button "Legg til" (Add).
Wait for the green tick to appear. Click the blue button "Lukk soknad/Send melding".
Fill member's first name in the email field, then send out a welcome message.
Close tab (x on the right top corner).

2.1 Push invoice to new member

Go to Member admin.
Go to Payments.
Go to the line [OSI Svomming Treningsavgift student H21]: Click "Unsent invoices".
Click the check boxes.
Click the blue button "Send fee to 2 recipients".
Click the blue button "Send fee".

3. Delete members and invoices
When members wish to withdraw, we need to cancel any membership fee invoices and delete their membership at OSI Svomming level. Note that we can only process the OSI Svomming level, NOT the OSI level. Email Truls with the former member's info so that he can delete them from OSI-level database.

Stay on the same page as in Task 1. Go to the left-hand side black menu. Go to "Medlemsadmin" (Membership management), then "Medlemmer" (Members), type names or part of names, press the magnifying glass button to search.

Once the member has been located, click all red buttons to turn them green. Then go to "Avgifter" (Fees), press the drop-down menu, then delete the invoice.

Reply to member's email to confirm this deletion and explain that they will still get invoices from OSI unless they contact OSI separately.
