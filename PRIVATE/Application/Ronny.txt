Hei hei Tony,

Let me comment on the upcoming interview (just some thoughts you may or may not consider):

(a)	Motivation: Try to work out here, among other things, how you envision contributing to CEMO. What do you think you may be able to add to the centre (research, teaching, others)?
(b)	Four tasks: When describing your thoughts about the four tasks, you can also acknowledge different possibilities (e.g., different methodological approaches) and limitations. You can also bring up the challenges you already anticipate (possible ways to deal with them?). This will give you a balanced description.
(c)	Master program teaching: Try to be specific about the possible course you think you wish to contribute to and say why.
(d)	Terms and conditions: possible starting date, moving to Oslo (if it applies), your expectations on the supervision, your additional questions.

Cheers,
Ronny
