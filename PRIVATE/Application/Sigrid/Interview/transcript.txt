Thank you Sigrid, Rolf and Bjorn for having me at this busy time of the year. I wish to start my story with my motivation:

1. Generic questions

1.1 Motivation for the application

I vividly remember | I wanted to apply for a CEMO PhD | one month into my exchange semester | back in 2018 | after frequent contacts with Saskia and Johan | behind each Data Science lecture, and every day after that | only reinforced this decision. What impressed me the most | was the depth and rigour | of CEMO's courses--we needed 100% commitment during lectures | and another 100% in after-hour study groups | just to survive the assignment and exams.

As I remembered more names, I started to notice CEMO professors' contributions | in almost every area | of education research. Subsequent googling only confirmed my understanding | that CEMO is where the bars are set--this realisation, I must admit, caused quite a bit of self-doubt, so I thought I would never be good enough to join this team.

Then | not too long before my return flight | to University of Melbourne, Anne-Catherine approached me | after one lecture. Now looking back, that conversation crystallised | a motivation | into an action. I then sat down with Sigrid | for the first time | to discuss a possibility | to continue my study at CEMO | after graduating from Australia, which led to this day.

I have always upheld myself | to a PhD candidate standard | during my master candidacy. I have organised my workflow | mimicking a CEMO staff member; I introduced myself | and lived with the CEMO family | through the two years. Some nick-named me "the CEMO baby" | which is rather accurate | as I grew up with CEMO's master degree from the very first lesson | and I feel this strong attachment | to this institute | both academically and socially.

During my master candidacy, every assignment I prepared, every exam I sat, every word I typed in my thesis, I tested it against this PhD standard: "Will this | make the Selection Committee | happy?" I was relieved to hear from my thesis examiners | that they considered my submission | to be above master-level expectation. I hope this exercise | of producing a formal piece of academic work | better prepared me for this PhD engagement.

1.2 Career plans

I position academia as my long-term goal. In addition to publications, I understand that | there will be increasing demand | on maintain professional platforms such as Open Science Foundation (OSF) and GitHub, social media engagement using Twitter and YouTube, as well as maintaining business ties with both other universities | and the industry. I will consciously work on these media skills and I trust my prior experience from Business | would lend a hand for building up a professional profile. I am also acutely aware | the need to learn Norwegian language--this is my summer plan | on top of conducting education equality literature review.

Secondly, I wish to service my Norwegian teacher registration | by maintaining close ties | with front-line teachers and school leaders | during my research. Lastly, I present myself for the management's consideration | should accounting and finance duties | need to be performed.

1.3 Professional collaboration

I have had the privilege | to work under the guidance of Trude and Nani | from ILS | as their research assistant | during my master candidacy. I learnt how to conduct literature screening, bibliography management, contact original authors for supplementary material | and coding literature for systematic reviews.

Earlier this year, Ronny further extended my professional network | to Germany and Luxembourg | by involving me in | more research projects | and more independent tasks.

Over this weekend, Ronny and Chia-Wen also started guiding me | to turn my master thesis | into a journal submission, potentially leading to a publication count | for CEMO | in the near future.

Outside of CEMO, my collaboration with EngageLab | has attract encouragement from Ole and Sten. My prototype of managing non-standardised tests | has now been escalated to insj, a student entrepreneur incubator, for further funding and development.

Lastly, I maintained my accounting and finance skills | by becoming the treasurer for the OSI Swimming club, further engaging with wider Norwegian society.

2. Four research tasks

2.1 Indicators of equality and equity

Measuring | education equality | can be a political process | as different indicators | may yield different policy proposals, potentially creating different cohorts of | winners and losers. Nobel laureate Amartya Sen (1980) advocated individual's [levels of functioning], such as literacy and nutrition, as the attributes to be equalised. Others saw the [opportunities] people face as the attributes to be equalised (Arneson 1989, Cohen 1989, and Roemer 1993). Yet | some | considered the amount of [resources] as the attribute to be equalised (Dworkin 1981).

Along the input-process-output pipeline, ILSA seems to frame education equality as the [distributional spread] at the output end | by capturing the differences between the 90th and 10th percentiles. Inequality in SES, accordingly, can be considered [input inequality].

Back in the early 2000s, the World Bank published a research paper proposing a Gini Coefficient approach | to measuring education inequality. This can be thought as an extension to the 90-10-percentile method by taking every percentile into consideration.

The current indicators for socio-economic status | is heavy on the "socio" component | but relatively weak on the "economic" part | largely due to privacy concerns. Fortunately, as students are aggregated to schools | then to countries| macroeconomic indicators start to become available at higher levels. If directly measuring economic inequality | is difficult at student-level, instead of discarding income as an SES indicator, could a multilevel setup partially improve our measurement model?

2.2 Linking procedures

Due to variations in test designs and difficulties, different ILSAs | and different waves of the same ILSA | must be | first of all | linked to the common scale through an IRT calibration process involving 2PL or 3PL for dichotomous items and PCM or GPCM for polytomous items.

2.3 Validation procedures

Validation procedure is where I am currently searching literature on | and will seek help from the research team immediately.

2.4 Potential trends

Current literature has identified interesting time trend in SES performance gap.

Sex differences in such gaps | could serve as one interesting starting point | as social attitudes towards sex roles underwent considerable reforms since the 1960s.

Another important trend could be | the divide between established vs emerging economies. Could the time trend between 1960s and 2010s be the same between these two camps of countries? An understanding of the interaction between individual learners and their economic environment may deepen our understanding of resource equality and process equality.

3. Teaching contributions

A natural starting point | for my teaching engagement | could be my master thesis, where I conducted in-depth reading, literature review | as well as computer programming | in multilevel models | and structural equation models. These topics directly lend themselves to CEMO's Multilevel Models and Measurement Models courses. I believe this could be one teaching area | I may contribute to | straight away.

Secondly, I enjoyed every step | of my thesis production | here in CEMO | and I wish to share this positive experience | with a wider audience | and turn it into productivity | for the next cohort of master students. I therefore wish to contribute to the Research Seminar series, by sharing my own folders, notes, time plans and GitHub repositories | with other. Learners often appreciate | getting hold of a master thesis to visualise | what the final product looks like | and what this "black box" | contains inside, so that they can design | their plan of attack | accordingly.

Inspecting prior year's master thesis | also brings structure and purpose for the Research Seminar sessions. Why should we learn APA7 and Zotero, for example. How to best manage long document production? Students are more motivated to learn | if they can see where this knowledge and skill fits into the final product. I freshly remember this process | and I believe I can engage | with beginning thesis writers | with passion and insight. So Research Seminar series are the second area | I offer my service to.

Thirdly, I wish to be helpful for R beginners, given the core importance | of this computer program | for the success of this master degree. I am able to organise a computer session | during orientation week | to set up everyone's computer, ready for Johan's Lesson 1, by installing and linking the many programs together correctly. I would be able to provide | 4 years of service | to beginners | to facilitate their smooth transition | into this degree | through Data Science and Linear Models.

As I accumulate more readings in constructing equality indicators | and linking procedures from my PhD, I would be in a better position | to start a second iteration of teaching service in, for example Constructing Measures and IRT. It would be a perfect circle | if I can contribute to each MAE course | at least once | by the end of my PhD.
