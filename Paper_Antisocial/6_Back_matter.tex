To ensure acceptable principles of ethical and professional conduct, the current study received approval from Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK) to utilize data gathered by the study of Evaluation of Functional Family Therapy in Norway \parencite{bjornebekk:2013}. All participants, both parents and adolescents gave written informed consent. Consent forms included information about participants' right to withdraw from the study at any given time, and ensured participants confidentiality. Participants consent forms were presented for Norwegian Center for Research Data (NSD) and Norwegian Data Protection Authority [Datatilsynet] \parencite{bjornebekk:2013}. All data were collected, stored, and processed within a certified secure IT environment \parencite[TSD,][]{tsd:2020}.
