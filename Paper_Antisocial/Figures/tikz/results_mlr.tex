}{This structural equation model predicts youth's antisocial behavior (ASB) from parental mental health (PMH), with mediating effects of family conflict (CON) and family cohesion (COH). Statistics are standardized regression coefficients pooled over ten imputed datasets, computed using MLR estimator. Solid lines' thickness is proportional to their estimates while dashed lines represent nonsignificant relations at $\alpha=.05$ level. Socioeconomic status (SES) forms serial mediations with PMH, CON, and COH, and is colored in grey.\\
