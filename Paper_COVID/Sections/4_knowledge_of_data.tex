\section{Knowledge of Data}

\subsection{Prior Publication/Dissemination}
We worked on no publications, working papers, or conference presentations based on the dataset we will use for this study.

\subsection{Prior Knowledge}
As at submission, the second author has commenced preparing the register data into the analysis-ready format. The second author has also generated descriptive statistics for all variables contained in the register database to assist other researchers with variable selection. This overview is merely administrative in nature with minimal insight into the fine structures of the variables. All co-authors do not have computer access to the datasets at submission. Public record from the Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training showed no major differences between 2019 and 2021 in student's reading and mathematics achievement, either between genders, immigration backgrounds or parental educational levels. We are also aware that the national test exemption rates have increased to 30 to 40 percent over the past five years. The authors report no other knowledge about the data, particularly relating to the variable relationships needed to answer our research questions.
