Answer "yes" to this question if the entire school or parts of the school has been closed in this period due to the Corona situation (outbreak, quarantine, or orders from the municipality chief medical officer etc). The school can register as closed independent of whether students with parents who are essential works, students with special needs or vulnerable, are accommodated in the school. The school can also register as closed if the school has digital offers or accommodations. When classes operate on rotating bases or alternating school attendance were required due to red levels, it should not be defined as closed.
