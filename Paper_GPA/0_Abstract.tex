\subsection{Research Topic}

Grade point averages (GPAs) play a determining role in Norway's tertiary admission processes. The academic track in Norwegian upper secondary education offers students a set of compulsory joint core subjects as well as a wide range of elective courses for different specialisations such as medicine and the language arts streams. Each subject awards participants a grade ranging from $1$ to $6$ for low- and high-competence respectively (kap. 3-5, Forskrift til oppl{\ae}ringslova 2020). Students' GPAs are then computed as sum scores from their subject grades. Fairness concerns arise as students enrolling in harder subjects are disadvantaged relative to their peers taking easier ones. Such disincentives drive students away from courses with stringent assessment criteria, adversely impacting on the human capital accumulation necessary for building Norway into a high-skill and high-pay economy.

Additionally, strong conditions must be met when aggregating ordinal information such as grades into cardinal indicators such as GPA. Earlier studies from the UK \parencite{he:2018} and the Netherlands \parencite{korobko:2008} questioned GPAs as an appropriate measure for graduates' academic competency out of methodological concerns such as violations of the unidimensionality assumption under the item response theory (IRT) framework. Examining \emph{whether Norway's GPA subjects differ in difficulty levels} therefore serves the dual-purpose of enhancing comparison fairness and ensuring GPAs' appropriateness as a selection device.

\subsection{Theoretical Framework}

IRT is particularly suitable in the educational measurement literature for extracting item difficulty parameters in order to study asseessment's comparison fairness. This study considers each GPA subject as an item and each candidate as a person. Using marginal maximum likelihood (MML) estimation, the analyses will ascertain difficulty parameters for all major subjects in Norwegian upper secondary schools. A second theoretical consideration relates to self-selection bias. Freedom in subject choices in Norway's upper secondary academic track inevitably produces rather sparse data matrix once all subjects and students are included. Since the presence or absence of observations was not resulted from randomisation but self-selection, and the missing likelihood is reasonably expected to covary with the subject difficulties, the observed GPA datasets shall be considered missing not at random \parencite[MNAR,][]{rubin:1976}. Leaving untreated, such non-ignorable missingness would cause over- and under-estimates of person and item parameters, respectively \parencite{rose:2013}. In order to assess the impact of non-ignorable missings on subject parameter estimates, IRT analyses will be repeated on three groups: the whole population, medical school applicants (low subject choice freedom) and language arts stream students (high freedom).

\subsection{Methodology}

Registry data containing Norwegian students' GPA performance in 2019 are first regularised by removing subjects with fewer than 1,000 candidate and candidates taking fewer than two subjects following the practices in \textcite{he:2018}. Candidates' grades are then recoded into a polytomous scale between $0$ and $5$ representing the low- and high-ends of the competency spectrum. Next, subject difficulty parameters will be extracted using generalised partial credit models \parencite[GPCM,][]{muraki:1992} over three sub-groups (whole population, medicine, and language arts). Lastly, the sensitivity analysis section will contain group invariance tests to assess the extend to which selection bias had impacted on subject difficulty parameter estimations.

\subsection{Expected Results}

The registry data set will be available for analysis in short time and the described analyses will be presented and discussed at the conference. Given that university entries in Europe is largely based on the final grades from secondary education, Norway's GPA system is expected to be comparable to the A Levels in the UK and the Central Examinations in Secondary Education in the Netherlands. More specifically, we expect Norway's GPA subjects to differ in difficulties \parencite[per report by][]{he:2018} and to exhibit significant selection effect \parencite[as demonstrated in][]{korobko:2008} represented by different difficulty parameters among the whole sample, medical school applicants, and language arts candidates.

\subsection{Relevance to Nordic Educational Research}

Researchers in Nordic countries are privileged to have access to national registry data, a gateway to nuanced information about individual-level phenomena. Consensus on a standard procedure for analysing registry data for educational research purposes, however, are yet to emerge that safeguards methodological accuracy as well as promotes social welfare at large. This study show cases a modular analysis design by explicitly addressing non-ignorable missing data issues before submitting the datasets to IRT modelling. Establishing and verifying the analytical procedures and properties of resultant estimates would directly benefit Nordic research communities using registry data.
