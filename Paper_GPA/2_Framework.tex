\subsection{Missing Data Treatment}

IRT item parameter estimation demands strong assumptions on the data missing mechanism. Joint, conditional and marginal maximum likelihood procedures are only valid under ``ignorable non-response'' conditions where missing propensities are related to neither item nor person parameters \parencite{molenaar:1995}. When test takers skip items after seeing their content, for example, the ignorablity condition is unlikely to hold \parencite{mislevy:1987}, neither are tests with items not reached due to time constraint \parencite{lord:1974, lord:1983}.
