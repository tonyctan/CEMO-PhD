Note: If you are using this CD for the first time, be sure to read the file "ReadmeCDROM.txt"
or "ReadmeCDROM.rtf" before you start. This gives instructions for copying files to your
hard drive and running them from the hard drive.

We include SAS version 8 and SPSS version 10 syntax for Chapter 6. SYSTAT syntax is not
included. Syntax that produces figures mirroring most figures in Chapter 6 is provided. The
actual figures in Chapter 6 were produced by other means.

The folder and file structure for Chapter 6 is as given below. There is one folder for Chapter
6. Within the Chapter 6 folder, there is one folder per COMPUTER ICON in the text. Within
the folder for an icon, there is one SPSS syntax file (e.g., c06e01sp.sps) , one SAS syntax file
(e.g., c06e01sa.sas), and the data accessed by both files (e.g., c06e01dt.txt). The format of
the data files is ascii DOS text, fixed format, no delimiters. Within each syntax file, the page
number of the ICON in the text is given at the top of the syntax; throughout the syntax, the
text page numbers, table and figure numbers for various analyses are given.
