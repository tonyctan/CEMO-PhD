REM--THE RANK CORRELATION EQUALS THE PRODUCT-MOMENT r PROVIDING THERE ARE NO TIED RANKS
LET D2 = (X -Y)*(X - Y)
STATS
STATS D2 /  Sum
REM-- TO GET THE RANK R MULTIPLY THE SUM OF D2 BY 6 AND DIVIDE BY N(Nsq -1) AND SUBTRACT THIS FROM ONE.
REM--SINCE N WAS 5 IN THIS EXAMPLE 5(25-1) = 120
REM--1-(26*6)/120
