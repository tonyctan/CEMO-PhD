Note: If you are using this CD for the first time, be sure to read the file "ReadmeCDROM.txt"
or "ReadmeCDROM.rtf" before you start. This gives instructions for copying files to your
hard drive and running them from the hard drive.

We include SAS version 8 and SPSS version 10 syntax for Chapter 13. SYSTAT syntax is not
included. 

The folder and file structure for Chapter 13 is as given below. There is one folder for Chapter
13. Within the Chapter 13 folder, there is one folder per COMPUTER ICON in the text.
Within the folder for an icon, there is one SPSS syntax file (e.g., c13e01sp.sps) , one SAS
syntax file (e.g., c06e01sa.sas), and the data accessed by both files (e.g., c13e01dt.txt). The
format of the data files is ascii DOS text, fixed format, no delimiters. Within each syntax file,
the page number of the ICON in the text is given at the top of the syntax; throughout the
syntax, the text page numbers, table and figure numbers for various analyses are given.
