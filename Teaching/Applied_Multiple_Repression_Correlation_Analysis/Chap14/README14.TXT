We include SAS version 8 and SPSS version 10 syntax for Chapter 14. SYSTAT syntax is not
included. 

The folder and file structure for Chapter 14 is as given below. There is one folder for Chapter
14. Within the Chapter 14 folder, there is one folder per COMPUTER ICON in the text.
Within the folder for an icon, there is one SPSS syntax file (e.g., c14e01sp.sps) , one SAS
syntax file (e.g., c06e01sa.sas), and the data accessed by both files (e.g., c14e01dt.txt). The
format of the data files are ascii DOS text, fixed format, no delimiters. Within each syntax
file, the page number of the ICON in the text is given at the top of the syntax; throughout the
syntax, the text page numbers, table and figure numbers for various analyses are given.
