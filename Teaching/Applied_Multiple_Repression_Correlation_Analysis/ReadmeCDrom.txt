Instructions for use of CD accompanying Cohen, Cohen, West, & Aiken (3RD Ed).
Jonathan Butner and Leona S. Aiken


The CD is structured with a master folder "CCWA" that contains all the computer files on the CD. To run the files from the CD, you should copy the whole directory CCWA from the CD to the "c" drive of your computer.  This will produce the following path for all files:   'c:\ccwa\xxx'. For example, the path for an SPSS syntax file for Example 3 in Chapter 6 is as follows:

       'c:\ccwa\chap06\ch06ex03\c06e03sp.sps'.

Within the master folder there is one folder for the numerical examples of each chapter, (e.g., CHAP02, CHAP03). Within the folder for each chapter is a Readme file (saved in several formats) that indicates what is in the folders in the chapter). 

Within the folders for Chapters 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, and 14, there are individual folders that correspond to each ICON in the margin of the chapter. For example, in Chapter 6, we have CH06EX01, CH06EX02, CH06EX03.  Within each of these folders, there is a SAS syntax file, an SPSS syntax file, and a data file, named, for example, C06E01sa.sas, C06E01sp.sps, and c06E01dt.txt, respectively. In addition, in Chapter 4, 8, and 10 there are graphics files (.gif) and SPSS Version 10 output files (.spo). These chapters contain no SYSTAT files. In addition there is one exception, in that in Chapter 14, there is no C14E03sp.sps.

The folders for Chapters 2, 3, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, are organized with all SAS syntax files in one folder, all SPSS syntax files in a second folder, all SYSTAT files in a third folder, and all data in a fourth folder. Chapter 15 contains EQS syntax as well. Not all programs are represented in every chapter (e.g., Chapter 16 contains only SYSTAT).

Editing Files

Files on this CD have Read-Only status.  Due to the nature of Windows, any direct copies of these files will retain the Read-Only status. For those who wish to edit the syntax files, this poses an obstacle (albeit one that can be easily overcome).  

For SPSS and SAS syntax, simply open the syntax file, and save the syntax file with a new name using the "save as" command. The "Read-Only" status will not pertain to the newly saved file.

Running in UNIX and on the MacIntosh

The syntax files on this CD are written to run in the Windows PC environment, including Windows 95, 98, 2000, and NT. To run the syntax on a UNIX-based operating system or on a Mac, you must modify the syntax that reads in the data files (e.g., 'data list' in SPSS, 'infile' in SAS). Please consult your SAS, SPSS, SYSTAT, or EQS manual for appropriate commands.
