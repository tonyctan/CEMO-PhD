Dear Oyun-Erdene,

Your labels "Step 1", "Step 2" etc. helped to break this long R script to readable chunks. You have skilfully used comments such as "# Deleting duplicates" to help me understand the purpose of your code.

Here are a couple of suggestions:
1. Make sure to load "readxl" package before using the "read_excel(...)" function. You can either type "library(readxl)" or "require(readxl)" to load the library, or you can use "readxl::read_excel(...)" to specify the package name along with the function.
2. You may remove/comment out install.packages(...) upon successfully installation.
3. Ensure your final product matches exactly what Johan asked for. The columns must follow this order: Person, Gender, Language, Item, Problem, Y, RT, Y.sub, RT.sub, Y.tot, RT.tot.

You are only one step away from completing this assignment. Please re-order the columns and everything is done. Thanks.
