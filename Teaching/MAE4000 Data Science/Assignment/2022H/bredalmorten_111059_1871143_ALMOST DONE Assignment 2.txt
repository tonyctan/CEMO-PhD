Dear Morten,

You are on the right track. Your code is well written and clearly labelled. I also like your skilful use of indentations.

In your R script, I suspect that Line 30 is causing error messages for Line 33. I skipped Line 30 and was able to continue.

Could Line 88 a duplicate of Line 84, please.

Line 102 to 105: Please refrain from printing out large data frames on screen.

I was able to run your code until Line 113. I noticed that you started recycling Ydata2 again after successfully implementing Ydata3 between Line 107 and 109. You may start from here when de-bugging.

Keep the good work and feel free to work with others. I am available all the time if you wish to ask any questions.

Good luck.
