      \[ \rho_{XY} = \frac{\cov{X}{Y}}{\sigma_X \, \sigma_Y} \]

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Correlation is a measure of the strength of the \ttemph{linear relationship} between two variables.
      \item The correlation coefficient is a number between $-1$ and $1$, where $0$ indicates no linear relationship, and $1$ or $-1$ indicates perfect a linear relationship.
      \item Correlations are superior to \\ttemph{covariances} for interpreting interrelationship between two variables thanks to the standardisation procedure.
    \end{itemize}
