    "### 0.1 Learning Intention\n",
    "This hand-on session aims to empower the `R` user community with a gentle introduction to the multiple imputation procedure in order to address missing data problems using one widely used `R` package: multivariate imputation by chained equations (`mice`, van Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011).\n",

    "At the end of this session, participants would gain *interest* and *confidence* in dealing with missing data in their work. \n",

    "### 1.1 Rationale for Multiple Imputation\n",
    "Complete-case analyses are only valid and unbiased under very restricted conditions (MCAR, defined below). Even when such condition holds, removing cases would cause huge loss in estimation efficiency. In addition, all resources and efforts may go to waste due to one single impurity in an observation. Multiple imputation tries to salvage imperfections by filling the \"holes\" with \"guesses\". The uncertainty of our guesses is reflected in the variation of the imputed values--the wider the variation, the less certain we are about our guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Two Approaches to Missing Data Treatment\n",
    "Joint modelling (JM, Schafter (1997); `R` package `jomo`) and fully conditional specification (FCS) are the two main approaches to missing data treatment. FCS is also known as multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE). This session will focus exclusively on the `R` package `mice` by van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn (2011), currently in Version 3.14.0, to demonstrate the power and flexibility of the MICE procedure for handling missing data. Other `R` packages that work with missing data are `Amelia`, `Hmisc`, `jomo`, `mi`, `norm`, `norm2` and `pan`. See Table 5.1 of Kleinke et al. (2020) for a comparison of these packages. Table 6 of Grund et al. (2018) provides specific advice on package uses for multilevel models."
