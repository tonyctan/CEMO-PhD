    "\n",
    "### 0.1 Learning Intention\n",
    "This learning session aims to empower the `R` user community with a gentle introduction to the multiple imputation procedure in order to address missing data problems using one widely used `R` package: multivariate imputation by chained equations (`mice`, van Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.2 Success Criteria\n",
    "At the end of this session, participants would gain *interest* and *confidence* in dealing with missing data in their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learners would be, firstly, able to assess the missing data mechanism in their datasets and apply appropriate treatment procedures accordingly. They can subsequently appreciate the workflow of `mice` and see how Rubin's rule is applied to the pulling process. Finally, learners are able to interpret `mice` output in order to answer their research questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, participants would continue their learning by reaching out to advanced MI literature for techniques suitable for their specific modelling needs.\n",

    "## 1. Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Rationale for Multiple Imputation\n",
    "Complete-case analyses are only valid and unbiased under very restricted conditions (MCAR, defined below). Even when such condition holds, removing cases would cause huge loss in estimation efficiency. In addition, all resources and efforts may go to waste due to one single impurity in an observation. Multiple imputation tries to salvage imperfections by filling the \"holes\" with \"guesses\". The uncertainty of our guesses is reflected in the variation of the imputed values--the wider the variation, the less certain we are about our guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Two Approaches to Missing Data Treatment\n",
    "**Joint modelling** (JM, Schafter (1997); `R` package `jomo`) and **fully conditional specification** (FCS) are the two main approaches to missing data treatment. FCS is also known as multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE). This session will focus exclusively on the `R` package `mice` by van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn (2011), currently in Version 3.14.0, to demonstrate the power and flexibility of the MICE procedure for handling missing data. Other `R` packages that work with missing data are `Amelia`, `Hmisc`, `jomo`, `mi`, `norm`, `norm2` and `pan`. See Table 5.1 of Kleinke et al. (2020) for a comparison of these packages. Table 6 of Grund et al. (2018) provides specific advice on package uses for multilevel models."

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Missing Completely at Random (**MCAR**)\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable's missing propensity is *independent* of all variables in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the \"least evil\" case of missings. Under MCAR, complete-case analyses are still valid and estimates unbiased--although efficiency is reduced due to smaller dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Missing at Random (**MAR**)\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable's missing propensity depends *exclusively* on the *observed* variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MAR assumption is behind most MI procedures, including `mice`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Missing not at Random (**MNAR**)\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable's missing propensity depends on *unobserved* variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "MNAR represents the \"most evil\" end of the spectrum. The exact theory and treatment of MNAR is complicated. Interested readers are referred to Rose's (2013) thesis for richer references. In practice, we can introduce lots of covariates to the MI process in order to push MNAR more towards the MAR region of the spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Ignorability\n",
    "The missing data literature commonly refers to MCAR and MAR as \"ignorable missings\" while to MNAR as \"non-ignorable missings\". Such vocabulary does *not* suggest no treatment is required, however, but whether subsequent analyses interact with the data missing process."
